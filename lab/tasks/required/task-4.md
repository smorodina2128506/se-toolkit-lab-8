# Containerize and Document

The bot has been running on your VM as a background process (`nohup`). That works for development, but it's fragile — it won't restart after a reboot, logs aren't managed, and it runs outside Docker while the backend runs inside. In this task, you containerize the bot so it runs alongside the backend as a proper Docker service.

## Requirements targeted

- **P3.1** Bot containerized with Dockerfile
- **P3.2** Added as service in `docker-compose.yml`
- **P3.3** Running as container on VM
- **P3.4** README documents deployment

## Deliverables

### 1. Bot Dockerfile (`bot/Dockerfile`)

Installs dependencies using `uv sync` from `bot/pyproject.toml` and runs the bot entry point.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do **not** use `requirements.txt` or `pip install`. The project uses `uv` and `pyproject.toml` exclusively. Having both `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt` leads to dependency drift and random breakage. If your coding agent generates a `requirements.txt`, delete it.

### 2. Bot service in `docker-compose.yml`

Add a `bot` service to the existing compose file:

- Connects to backend via Docker network (service name, not `localhost`)
- Reads `BOT_TOKEN` and LLM credentials from environment
- Restarts unless stopped

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Docker networking change.** Until now, the bot ran on the host and used `localhost:42002` to reach the backend. Inside Docker, `localhost` means the container itself. The bot must use the Docker service name instead: `http://app:8000`.
>
> **Qwen proxy networking.** The Qwen Code API proxy is a **separate** docker-compose project — it's on a different Docker network. The bot container can't reach it by service name or via `localhost`. To reach host-mapped ports from inside a container on Linux, use `extra_hosts` with `host.docker.internal`:
>
> ```yaml
> bot:
>   extra_hosts:
>     - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
> ```
>
> Then use `http://host.docker.internal:42005/v1` as the LLM API base URL.

### 3. README deploy section

Add a "Deploy" section to the project README explaining: required env vars, docker compose commands, how to verify.

## Verify

On your VM, stop the background bot process and switch to Docker:

```terminal
cd ~/se-toolkit-lab-7

# Stop the nohup bot
pkill -f "bot.py" 2>/dev/null

# Start everything with Docker
docker compose --env-file .env.docker.secret up --build -d
docker compose --env-file .env.docker.secret ps
```

You should see the `bot` service running alongside `app`, `postgres`, `caddy`. Then open Telegram and send `/start` — the bot should respond just like before, but now from inside a container.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `bot/Dockerfile` exists.
- [ ] `docker-compose.yml` includes a `bot` service.
- [ ] Bot container running (`docker ps` shows it).
- [ ] Backend still healthy (`curl -sf http://localhost:42002/docs` returns 200).
- [ ] `git remote get-url origin` matches student's GitHub repo.
- [ ] README has a section with "deploy" in heading.
- [ ] Bot responds in Telegram from the container (TA-verified).
- [ ] Git workflow followed.
